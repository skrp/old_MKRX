[a - h] : MKRX TOOLSET

a_SCRUB.pl - verifies the file to its sha
b_CHKMETA.pl - confirms uniq file has metadata
c_UNIQ.pl - checks sha against archive
d_SHA.pl - recursive sha extraction
e_POP.pl - use list to populate dump
f_INDEX.pl - create meta masterlists
g_HASH.pl - create hash files from meta
h_FILT.pl - terminal interface *****************

Preserving more than 7.2 Million
Unique files of significance

each file stored as its $sha
metadata is stored as 'g'$sha

ZFS over BSD
SICC Implementation:

Files are split into blocks
Named after the sha256sum

All files in one directory
All metadata in another directory

This isolation of metadata from data
Allows for public gibberish
To be private information
Via SICC_QUI files
