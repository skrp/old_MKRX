each file stored as its $sha
metadata is stored as 'g'$sha

SCRUB.pl - verifies the file to its sha
CHKMETA.pl - confirms uniq file has metadata
INDEX.pl - checks if a file is uniq
SHASCAN.pl - extract sha & file recursive
POP.pl - use list to populate dump

ZFS over BSD
Preserving more than 5.5 Million
Unique files

SICC Implementation:

Files are split into blocks
Named after the sha256sum

All files in one directory
All metadata in another directory

This isolation of metadata from data
Allows for public gibberish
To be private information
Via SICC_QUI files
